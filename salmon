# Transcripts were quantified using Salmon (v0.8.1) in alignment based mode
# Samples were quantified individually for both 5Y and sequin data

# Human transcripts
salmon quant -t GRCh38.cDNA.ncRNA.all.fasta -l A -a diff2/diff2.bam -o diff2_5y

#Sequin transcripts
salmon quant -t rna_sequins.fasta -l A -a diff2/diff2.bam -o diff2_sequins
